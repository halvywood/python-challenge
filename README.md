This is my Python in Studio Visual Code homework repository.
Included in this repository is written code, named PyBank, that analyzes data in a csv for a company's financial records.
Also included is written code, named PyPoll that analyzes data in a csv file for the results of an election poll from a small rural town.
These seperate sets of code will output results to a Git terminal and will also each output the same results to a text file.
Text files for both results also reside inside this repository.
